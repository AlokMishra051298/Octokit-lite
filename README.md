## Features

[Unfork](http://unfork.vercel.app/) will help you to easily identify all the forks that you have made over the _months_ or _years_ and **unfork** them all!

- [x] View your repository count.
- [x] You can choose what repos to delete before actually deleting them.
- [x] View what the forks that you have deleted.
- [ ] Allow users to filter forks by inactivity level (e.g. last repo commit date/their last personal commit date to the repo)
- [ ] Generates an optional shell command for you to run to backup all the forks that you are going to delete before deleting them.

## Problem

GitHub forks tend to be created for the following reasons:
1. Following tutorials ðŸ“–
1. Contributing to open source projects ðŸ’»
1. GitHub automatically forking stuff for you when you just wanted to view the source code for a particular file of a project ðŸ˜†

After months and years, usually these forks still stay in your repository â€” and that's because of how inconvenient it is to identify and delete the many forks that you have made. This results in cluttering of your GitHub profile. Unfork helps you to declutter easily âœ¨
